### Task List

MVC application as seen in the Microsoft video at this [link](http://www.asp.net/mvc/videos/mvc-2/how-do-i/creating-a-tasklist-application-with-aspnet-mvc). In the tutorial, Visual Basic and LINQ to SQL are used to create and save data for the Task List. 

However, I created the application in ASP.NET using C# as the programming language.
